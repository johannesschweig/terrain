# Original Creator Information and License

Martin O'leary (mewo2), drawing on D3 and Adam Hooper's js-priority-queue.

This project is, from my perspective, finished.

The code is available under the [MIT license][license], so you can fork it,
improve it, learn from it, build upon it. However, I have no interest in
maintaining it as an ongoing open source project, nor in providing support for
it. Pull requests will be either ignored or closed.

If you do make something interesting with this code, please do still let me know! I'm sorry that I can't provide any support, but I am still genuinely interested in seeing creative applications of the code.
